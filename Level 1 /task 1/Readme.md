### âœ… Level 1 â€“ Task 1: Data Exploration & Preprocessing

**Objective**: Understand and clean the dataset, inspect data structure, handle missing values, and analyze the distribution of the target variable `Aggregate rating`.

#### ðŸ”¹ Dataset Info:
- Records: 9,551
- Columns: 21
- Encoding used: `ISO-8859-1` due to special characters

#### ðŸ”¹ Actions Taken:
- Displayed dataset dimensions
- Checked for missing values (only 9 in `Cuisines`)
- Verified and adjusted data types
- Analyzed distribution of `Aggregate rating`

#### ðŸ”¹ Key Insights:
- The dataset is clean and well-structured
- High class imbalance in `Aggregate rating` (22% have 0.0 rating)
- Most restaurants are clustered in the 3.0â€“4.5 rating range

#### ðŸ“Š Visuals:
- Heatmap of missing values
- Histogram of rating distribution

âœ… This exploration sets a strong foundation for future analysis and modeling tasks.
